  <h1>Privacy Policy for GeetManzil</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 3, 2025</p>

  <p>
    GeetManzil is an offline app that provides Christian Geets and Zaboors for personal use. 
    Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, 
    and your rights regarding your information.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    GeetManzil does <strong>not</strong> require you to create an account and does <strong>not</strong> collect personally identifiable information such as your name, phone number, or address. 
    The app does not track your activity across other applications or websites.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Stored Locally on Your Device</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Favorites & Collections:</strong> The Geets and Zaboors you add to favorites or collections are stored only on your device using local database storage (SQLite).</li>
    <li><strong>Backups & Restore:</strong> If you choose to create a backup, your data is saved locally as a ZIP file. You control when and where you save or restore this file.</li>
    <li><strong>Appearance & Settings:</strong> Theme preferences and other settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    None of this information is sent to our servers or shared with third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Optional Information</h2>
  <p>
    When creating a Collection, you may optionally set a name, description, and choose a local image. 
    This information is also stored only on your device and is not transmitted anywhere.
  </p>

  <h2>Future Features</h2>
  <p>
    In future versions of GeetManzil, features such as worship time reminders (alarms), 
    content categories, and advertisements may be introduced. 
    If advertisements are added, they may be provided by third-party ad networks, 
    which could collect limited information such as device identifiers to serve relevant ads. 
    This Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly when such features are introduced.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    GeetManzil is safe to use for all ages. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    Since your data is stored only on your device, its security depends on your deviceâ€™s security. 
    We recommend keeping your device password-protected and backing up your data responsibly.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in features or data handling practices. 
    Updates will be available within the app and/or on our official website.
